# Zomato dataset - data cleaning - project description

### What did I do in this project?
1. Removed the unwanted columns.
2. Dealt with missing values in some columns.
3. Applied conditional filtering to remove the entries of those orders in which people haven't voted.
4. Renamed a few columns accordint to my suitability.
5. Grouped columns, and applied a mean aggregate method to all the aggregate values of the categorical columns.
6. Created a simple statistical description of the entire Dataframe.
7. Displayed few important points from the statistics.

Note:  
I am a beginner, who is in learning **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**. So I am not a pro in data analytics. In this small project, it was my first time to deal with real world data.  
But soon I will become better as I am trying hard, and putting efforts consistently.
